### Skeleton
—
There are some change between original wireframes and final site, however, most of there are same as planned. 
When I start the site, I want to present my own photo to rise creditability. However I choose all the images more related to work wise. I want to give impression to user that this is more focus on professionally rather than personally.  Name and title will give clear idea about the site concept and choose minimal contacts to deliver only important information to user. I wish all the user found information. All nav and social icons present clear and easily found, try to give consistency through the pages.


 #### Wireframes
This website have four pages. The wireframes do not match with my final projext exactly, however, I can say almost as planed. 
 - Landing Page: welcoming page

 - Contact Page:

### Surface
—

I want to keep the consistency as professional work concept whole the pages. Choose dark background color and white color text tones of nav and footer , So user can easily navigate all the menu. Also, use yellow color of texts to emphasise some of body titles to catch the attention. Try to publish simple and accurate information. Therefore, all the fonts and icons colors are consistence and repeated.  

 #### Design

  - Color Scheme : Mainly Black and white. And use bright yellow color to emphasis some of headlines. 


  - Typography : Mainly  "Exo", sans-serif font and "Roboto", sans-serif font used through out the whole website. I try to make all pages look simple and as same time all the pages have same concept. 


  -  Imagery : I used three images. First one with simply and modern style laptop, small illustration of girl and programming hands. I tried to all the concepts are related professional work concept with each pages.
